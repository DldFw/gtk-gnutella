To regenerate the GUI source code from the Glade file, type

    make glade_files
    

Some simple guidelines to add a net setting to the GUI:

Most of the time a new settings will need to be bound to a property.
E.g. spinbutton_up_connections should be bound to PROP_UP_CONNECTIONS.
To achive this, simply:

* add the desired widget (GtkSpinButton or GtkToggleButton) to the GUI 
  using Glade and give it the proper name (in this case 
  "spinbutton_up_connections". You do not need to add any callbacks within
  Glade. The callbacks will be added by the GUI core within Gtk-gnutella
  later.
* Add a new entry to the property_map in settings_gui.c. In this case it
  should look like:
  {
    get_main_window,
    PROP_UP_CONNECTIONS,
    update_spinbutton,
    TRUE,
    "spinbutton_up_connections"
  }
  
get_main_window is a function which will fetch the current instance of
the main window. If you place the widget within another window or 
popup menu, this needs to be replaced.
  
PROP_UP_CONNECTIONS is the name of the property you want to bind to.
  
update_spinbutton is the generic GtkSpinButton callback. It will simply
set the value within the widget when the property has changed. If you need
other actions to take place, you just create a custom callback and place
it's name here instead.
  
TRUE means, that the callback (see above, here update_spinbutton) will be
called when the GUI is initialized. This should almost always be TRUE, so
the GUI widget will reflect the state of the bound properties on startup.
  
"spinbutton_up_connections" is the name of the widget.

The above also works for GtkToggleButtons with the generic callback being
update_togglebutton. For other widgets/properties you may need to do more
work, especially you have to add callbacks within Glade and you need to
provide those callbacks somewhere in the GUI code. Most of the time
these callbacks will end up in settings_cb.c.
